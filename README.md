1.	target the potential customers in 2018 which will result in the lowest claim amounts. For example:
a.	find customers with a low probability of having any claims
b.	find customers with the lowest cost per claim, given that a claim occurs

2.	create a marketing campaign that engages with potential 2018 customers based on their risk profiles (e.g.  letting riskier customers know about educational opportunities, which will benefit both the customer and insurance company by reducing the risk of claims).  
In order to do that, the manager must make several risk profile ‘groups’ to be used in this campaign.

For personal auto manager: 
Segment the potential customers into four groups based on the current risk profiles. 
Based on the existing data, the different plans can be applied for the potential customers
For a group of data scientists:
Three models were built for analysis (classification, regression, and clustering).
There are four parts to build the classification, regression, and clustering model: load and data cleaning, data exploration and feature engineering, training the model/hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation, and predictive model building.
Next step: model implementation (big data or on-time) and model monitoring (model retrain)
These models are the starting point but need more models to work together, such as model can investigate the reason of one-time high cost payoff.
